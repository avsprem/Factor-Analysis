This project applies factor analysis to a medical dataset to uncover latent structures among diagnostic features used to predict diabetes. Using both Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the goal is to reduce dimensionality, improve model performance, and address challenges like overfitting and multicollinearity. The dataset focuses on female Pima Indian adults aged 21 and above, with a binary target indicating diabetes diagnosis.
